# Data Analytics Tech Challenge

## Objective 
The objective of this repository is to demonstrate exploratory data analysis techinques along with visualising data using Tableau Public. 

The challenge demonstrates the following skills,  
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Data Visualisation using python (matplotlib, seaborn) and Tableau Public. 
3. Data cleaning and feature engineering using python (pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn).
4. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for hypothesis testing. 

## Data
The data used for this analysis is taken from Yellow Taxi Trip Records based around NYC. The data is primarily for January 2022. It can be access at https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page 

Additional geospatial data is also sourced from the same location.

## Problem Statement
TaxiCab is your neighbourhood friendly Taxi service making your life easier to commute through the busy streets of New York City. Since it 
began operations in 2019, the taxi service has really picked up and has become the number one service to use in NYC. 
 
Unfortunately, the CEO of TaxiCab, Henry Bentley, does not have complete visibility on how well his company is doing and is not sure if there 
are potential opportunities that can help his business scale further. Henry has access to all the data but is looking for a Data Analyst with a 
keen eye to detail to help him with drawing insight from the data. Sometimes the data is very messy and may require additional cleaning 
before any analysis can be done.  
 
You have won the proposal to help Henry with this problem statement and have chosen you to develop the solution for them. In 
their requirement gathering phase, these are the areas of concern they want to target: 
• Average tip received by a vendor during the day 
• Which time of the day is the busiest? 
• Clean the Data and fix any anomalies 
• Classify trips based on Payment Type (not the number in the excel sheet but the actual payment type. Use metadata table for 
reference) 
• Is there any relationship between congestion surcharge and trip distance? 
The outcome needs to be in the form of a report/dashboard/presentation in a visualisation tool of your choice.

## Visualisations

Visualisation for the above data can be found at,
[Soham Sarfare - Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/soham.sarfare/viz/VisualizingNYCTaxiCabTrips/ZoneWiseTripAnalysis?publish=yes)

The visualisations contain the following,
* Fare and Trips Summary - Interactive Dashboard explaining Fare and Trip summary broken down by Vendor ID, Payment Type Class, Busiest Hours of the day along with average tip per Vendor.
* Zone Wise Distribution of Trips - Interactive Dashboard showcasing distribution of number of trips and fare total over the boroughs and zones of NYC.
* Zone Wise Trip Analysis - Interactive Story detailing earnings and recommendations of the various zones and keypoints of NYC.
